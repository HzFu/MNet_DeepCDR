**Code for TMI 2018 "Joint Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation Based on Multi-label Deep Network and Polar Transformation"**

Project homepage：http://hzfu.github.io/proj_glaucoma_fundus.html

## Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Install package

    pip install .

OpenCV will need to be installed separately.

1. The code is based on: *TensorFlow 1.14 (with Keras) + Matlab*
2. The deep output is raw segmentation result without ellipse fitting. The Matlab code is the ellipse fitting and CDR calculation (by using PDollar toolbox: https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/).
3. You can run the 'Step\_3\_MNet\_test.py' for testing any new image directly.
4. We also provided the validation and test results on [REFUGE dataset](https://refuge.grand-challenge.org/home/) in 'REFUGE\_result' fold.
5. **Note: Due to the 'scipy.misc.imresize' in SciPy 1.0.0 has been removed in SciPy 1.3.0, the original trained model 'Model\_MNet\_REFUGE.h5' is not suitable. If you want to segment disc/cup from fundus image, you can consider our newest methods: CE-Net and AG-Net, which obtain the better performances and are also released in:**
	- CE-Net: [https://github.com/Guzaiwang/CE-Net](https://github.com/Guzaiwang/CE-Net) 
	- AG-Net: [https://github.com/HzFu/AGNet](https://github.com/HzFu/AGNet)
6. A pytorch implementation of M-Net could be found in **AG-Net**: [https://github.com/HzFu/AGNet](https://github.com/HzFu/AGNet)

**Note: for ORIGA and SCES datasets**

Unfortunately, the ORIGA and SCES datasets cannot be released due to the clinical policy.
But, here is an other glaucoma challenge, [**Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE)**](https://refuge.grand-challenge.org/home/), including disc/cup segmentation, glaucoma screening, and localization of Fovea.
